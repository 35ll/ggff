Mount Melbourne is a 2,733-metre-high (8,967 ft) ice-covered stratovolcano 
in Victoria Land, Antarctica, between Wood Bay and Terra Nova Bay. It is 
an elongated mountain with a summit caldera filled with ice with numerous 
parasitic vents; a volcanic field surrounds the edifice. Mount Melbourne 
has a volume of about 180 cubic kilometres (43 cu mi) and consists of 
tephra deposits and lava flows; tephra deposits are also found encased 
within ice and have been used to date the last eruption of Mount Melbourne 
to 1892 Â± 30 CE. The volcano is fumarolically active.

The volcano is part of the McMurdo Volcanic Group, and together with The 
Pleiades, Mount Overlord, Mount Rittmann and the Malta Plateau forms a 
subprovince, the Melbourne volcanic province. The volcanism is related both 
to the West Antarctic Rift and to local tectonic structures such as faults 
and grabens.[a] Mount Melbourne has mainly erupted trachyandesite and 
trachyte, which formed within a magma chamber; basaltic rocks are less common.
